# A-cost-effective-secure-and-efficient-network-layout-design
Designed a highly cost-effective, secure, and efficient network design for an account and management company. 
Introduction
Songlarp Harbees Corporation (SHC), an old medium size accounting and management company with approximately 30 staff and 20 PCs, is planning to revamp its entire outdated computer and network system to the one that would propel them to new e-business era. They are going to offer services through Internet as well as intranet for their staff.
1) All devices are connected in a single network though hubs and switches.
2) Connection to ISP is open to everybody via a normal router using a 10MBps broadband.
3) Certain users have privilege to be connected to Internet via a direct cellular dongle.
4) All users are using Windows 7 professional SP1 64bit.
5) The server is Windows Server 2012 Standard Edition.
6) They also have two networked printers.
SHC plans the following:
1) Get its own fixed IP and use private IP internally. Their fixed IP is 202.100.2.3/24 and their private IP is 192.168.x.0 where x is your group no.
2) Break the internal network into 4 segments; Staff, Management, Development, and Services.
3) Upgrade all users to use latest Windows.
4) Upgrade all servers appropriately.
5) The Services segment should have appropriate servers to support their own Web hosting using Microsoft solution but MySQL database.
6) To keep the cost at minimum, their Development segment uses Unix solution to maintain the system. As such, it needs to duplicate the Service segment.
7) The Staff and Management should have appropriate servers and printers to support its operation.
8) New broadband services will be subscribed appropriately, and direct Internet access should be addressed accordingly.
9) All network solutions should be wireless except the connection to the ISP.
10) Renovation will be done to change the layout, enlarge server room and to add Development Department.
11) Adopting related Information security policies, standards, and procedures.
